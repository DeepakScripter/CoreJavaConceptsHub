# Java Exception_Management

This repository contains a set of Java code examples illustrating various aspects of exception handling and file operations. Each Java class demonstrates specific scenarios and techniques related to handling both checked and unchecked exceptions.

## List of Exception Handling Classes

1. **CheckedExceptionExample.java**
   - Demonstrates handling checked exceptions like `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException` using try-catch blocks.

2. **ExceptionExample.java**
   - Illustrates the handling of multiple exceptions, including `ArithmeticException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `NullPointerException`, `NumberFormatException`, and `IOException`.

3. **ExceptionHandling.java**
   - Covers basic exception handling scenarios, including try-catch blocks and the usage of `finally` for cleanup operations.

4. **ExceptionInFinallyBlock.java**
   - Explores the behavior of exceptions occurring within the `finally` block.

5. **ExceptionPropagation.java**
   - Shows how exceptions can be propagated through multiple methods using the `throws` keyword.

6. **FileHandling.java**
   - Provides examples of various file operations, including writing, reading, appending, renaming, copying, and deleting files.

7. **MultipleTryCatch.java**
   - Demonstrates handling multiple exceptions using separate catch blocks for each exception type.

8. **NestedTryCatch.java**
   - Illustrates the use of nested try-catch blocks for handling exceptions in different scopes.

9. **NestedTryCatchFinallyExample.java**
   - Extends the nested try-catch concept by including a `finally` block in both the inner and outer scopes.

10. **ThrowKeyword.java**
    - Utilizes the `throw` keyword to explicitly throw a custom exception.

11. **ThrowThrowsExample.java**
    - Demonstrates the use of `throw`, `throws`, and a custom exception.

12. **ThrowsKeyword.java**
    - Highlights handling checked exceptions using the `throws` clause.

13. **UncheckedExceptionExample.java**
    - Illustrates unchecked exceptions, specifically `ArithmeticException` and `NullPointerException`.

Feel free to explore each example for a detailed understanding of the covered concepts. Happy coding!
