# OOPS_Concepts

Welcome to this collection of Java code snippets illustrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each file showcases a specific OOP concept in Java. Explore and understand the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism through these examples.

## Table of Contents

1. [**Abstraction.java**](Abstraction.java)
   - A sophisticated Java codebase showcasing an abstract class, "Shape," implementing abstract methods and providing a concrete implementation in derived classes.

2. [**ConstructorCreation.java**](ConstructorCreation.java)
   - Explore the versatility of constructors in Java. The code demonstrates different types of constructors and their usage in Java classes.

3. [**Encapsulation.java**](Encapsulation.java)
   - This Java code demonstrates the concept of encapsulation using a "Car" class. It includes private instance variables, constructor, getter and setter methods, and a method to display information.

4. [**HierarchicalInheritance.java**](HierarchicalInheritance.java)
   - Java code showcasing Hierarchical Inheritance in object-oriented programming. It includes base class "Animal" and three derived classes - "Dog," "Cat," and "Bird."

5. [**Interface.java**](Interface.java)
   - Java code exemplifying interface usage in OOP. The 'Shape' interface includes abstract methods, a default method, a constant variable, and a static method. The 'Circle' and 'Square' classes implement this interface.

6. [**InterfaceExtension.java**](InterfaceExtension.java)
   - Explore interface extension in OOP with Java. The 'Shape' interface is extended with a 'Colorable' interface. The 'ColoredSquare' class implements both interfaces.

7. [**MethodOverloading.java**](MethodOverloading.java)
   - Java code illustrating Method Overloading in OOP. It includes multiple methods with different parameter lists, demonstrating method overloading.

8. [**MethodOverriding.java**](MethodOverriding.java)
   - Java code exemplifying Method Overriding in OOP. The 'Animal' base class has a method 'makeSound,' which is overridden in the derived class 'Dog.' Additional methods specific to the 'Dog' class are also included.

9. [**MultilevelInheritance.java**](MultilevelInheritance.java)
   - Explore Multilevel Inheritance in Java OOP. The 'Vehicle' is the base class, 'Car' is derived from 'Vehicle,' and 'SportsCar' is derived from 'Car.'

10. [**MultipleInheritance.java**](MultipleInheritance.java)
    - Java code illustrating Multiple Inheritance using interfaces. The 'ColoredCircle' class implements both 'Shape' and 'Color' interfaces.

11. [**MyInterfaceAcessModifiers.java**](MyInterfaceAcessModifiers.java)
    - Java code showcasing interface access modifiers and static methods. The 'MyInterfaceAcessModifiers' class implements the 'MyInterface' interface.

12. [**NewKeyword.java**](NewKeyword.java)
    - Java code illustrating the usage of the 'new' keyword. The class includes examples of creating objects and arrays using the 'new' keyword.

13. [**ObjectCreation.java**](ObjectCreation.java)
    - Java code showcasing diverse methods of object creation. It includes constructor usage, static factory method, and object cloning.

14. [**SimpleInheritance.java**](SimpleInheritance.java)
    - Java code illustrating simple inheritance. The 'Vehicle' is the base class, and 'Car' is derived from 'Vehicle.'

15. [**StaticNon_Static_InstanceBlock.java**](StaticNon_Static_InstanceBlock.java)
    - Java code illustrating static and instance initializer blocks. It includes a static initializer block, an instance initializer block, and a non-static method.

16. [**SuperKeyword.java**](SuperKeyword.java)
    - Java code demonstrating the use of the 'super' keyword in inheritance. The 'SuperKeyword' class includes a base class 'Animal' and a derived class 'Dog.'

17. [**ThisKeyword.java**](ThisKeyword.java)
    - Java code illustrating the use of the 'this' keyword. The 'ThisKeyword' class includes a 'Person' class with instance variables, a constructor, and methods utilizing 'this' to distinguish between instance variables and parameters.
