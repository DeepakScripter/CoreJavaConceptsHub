# Java Multi_Threading 

This repository contains a set of Java code examples illustrating various concepts and techniques related to multithreading. Each Java class demonstrates specific scenarios and methods related to managing and synchronizing threads.

## List of Multithreading Classes

1. **Multithreading.java**
   - Consolidates multiple multithreading examples in the `Multithreading` class.

2. **MultithreadingCorruption.java**
   - Illustrates thread safety issues and demonstrates how synchronization can prevent data corruption in multithreaded environments.

3. **MultithreadingMethod.java**
   - Showcases various methods available in the `Thread` class for managing threads, including `sleep()`, `yield()`, and `join()`.

4. **SuspendResume.java**
   - Implements the `suspend()` and `resume()` methods to showcase thread suspension and resumption. Note: These methods are deprecated and not recommended for modern use.

5. **SynchronizationExample.java**
   - Demonstrates thread-safe operations using synchronization to avoid race conditions.

6. **SynchronizationWithStaticMethod.java**
   - Illustrates synchronization with static methods to showcase coordinated access to shared resources.

7. **SynchronizedBlockExample.java**
   - Highlights synchronization using a synchronized block to ensure thread-safe incrementing of a counter.

8. **SynchronizedExample.java**
   - Implements synchronization with methods to ensure safe incrementing of a counter by multiple threads.

9. **ThreadLifecycle.java**
   - Illustrates the various states a thread goes through in its lifecycle, including `New`, `Runnable`, `Blocked`, `Waiting`, `Timed Waiting`, and `Terminated`.

10. **ThreadScheduler.java**
    - Showcases thread scheduling with different thread priorities using the `setPriority()` method.

Feel free to explore each example for a detailed understanding of the covered concepts. Happy coding!
